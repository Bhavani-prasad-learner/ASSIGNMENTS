Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 

1.   Defined a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using  recursion.
      condition for recursion is num*factorial(num-1)
       where num is user given number
3.   Returns the calculated factorial.
4. prints the returned output

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
 
1.   asks  the user for a number as input.
     and number is stored in num variable
2. from math module sqrt,sin,log funtions are imported 
3.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
   o   Square root of the number
    o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
    o   Sine of the number (in radians)
4.displayed the output
